# **SQL in Layman's Terms:**

  Hey, there come join me to explore the basics of SQL. 
  
  #### **WHAT IS SQL??**
  This is the first question that comes into our mind when starting to learn new technology. Yes, you are on the right track if this question comes to your mind. *SQL is a Structured query language, so it's a language that is used to communicate with databases* similar to us, for example, we use various languages such as English as I am communicating with you. It is very effortless to grapple with the syntax used in SQL. Let's deep dive into the syntax that we will be using.
    
  Here, we can assume that we all work in a department store and if any customer asks you to pick a shampoo bottle what we will do is *SELECT* a shampoo that is requested by the customer and then handover to them. Yes, SELECT is the keyword that we will be using to fetch the required data. Here we will jump into our syntax,
  
  ***SELECT SHAMPOO FROM STORE;***
  
  To add some more filter criteria in it, if the customer requests for XXX shampoo then comes into the picture is the *WHERE* clause,
  
  ***SELECT SHAMPOO FROM STORE WHERE BRAND='XXX';***
  
Note: Add colons '' for the filter criteria as we have mentioned above.
